			<p>I, <strong>Greg Conrad</strong> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my 
	   			<strong>Spring 2018, WEB-250-85, Database Driven Websites</strong> with my 
	   			instructor, <strong> D. I. von Briesen</strong>.</p> 
	   		<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will 
	   			be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is 
	   			inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p> 
	   
	   		<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for 
	   			attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in 
	   			assignments may show as absences.</p>
